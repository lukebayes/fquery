h1. FQuery

FQuery is a development framework for Flash content that was entirely inspired by the JavaScript JQuery framework created by John Ressig. This framework will implement CSS selectors that allow us to traverse and manipulate the Flash display list.

The real power of this implementation is that we can modify any public accessor from the selector interface.
